A package for parsing, processing and analyzing [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/) output files in R.

## This is not the _slimr_ you are looking for

Please be aware that this package is no longer being developed or maintaned and is unlikely to work on recent versions of SLiM.

If you found this repository by searching for the _slimr_ R package, it is very likely you are looking for [different _slimr_](https://github.com/rdinnager/slimr).

## Installation

You need to install `devtools` first:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bodkan/slimr")

library(slimr)
```
